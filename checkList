______________checklist for running the job______________

--    ./All_clear.sh clears the folder completely 

--    Check job run time (i.e. 48 hours?)

--    run either ./edit_arc-local.sh or ./edit_local-arc.sh depending on where the job will be ran

--    ./Allrun works locally
--    job.sh works on ARC3

-- Push to github before running on ARC
